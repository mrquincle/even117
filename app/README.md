# Android app

The online world can be threating to people, especially elderly. The ease with which younger people bridge the online
and offline world is very difficult for them. Not opening the door to one strange looking guy, but opening it to 
someone who just wants to bring in some groceries. Simple calls of judgement, become hard online. This application
makes it easier to bridge this gap by involving other people in judgement calls. "Can I trust this person?" will not
be just a question your grandma asks herself. It will be a question she can share with you, her grandchild. Obviously,
in the perfect world you visit your grandma everyday, but because of time and space this is just not always possible.
We would like with this to give you the opportunity to help your grandma in the online world. As a personal assistant
for all matters digital, you might be able to find her someone that does carry the heavy potatoes from the store for 
example.
